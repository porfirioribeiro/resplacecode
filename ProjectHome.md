resplace.net is a new website created to house open source projects started and maintained by a group of developers, the website was setup by two friends Porifrio and Dean, who want to offer great quality and freely available applications for everyone to use and abuse.


Current projects in the repository are as follows:

**OpenWebMS** - Modular based website management system, created to allow easy creation and manipulation of a website, fast, secure and for advanced developers.

Other projects will begin to join this repository as soon as we get a nice stable version of OpenWebMS done, this is because we will be using our engine to build the resplace website.


**We are currently looking for developers!**

We are looking for programmers who can program in one or more of the following languages: PHP, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, JAVA and would like to help work on and maintain projects.

We are also after some graphics artists for minor work, we would be very much happy to receive some help!

(Btw... Dean likes men)
